## A chrome browser extension that can answer your questions about a webpage

### Initial Setup for backend system (only need to do once):

-   Create a virtual environment to install packages

    -   `python -m venv venv`

-   Activate it (depending on your OS)\

    -   Windows: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
    -   MacOS/ Unix: `source venv/bin/activate`

    Once you can see the name of your virtual environment—in this case (venv)—in your command prompt, then you know that your virtual environment is active. You’re all set and ready to install your external packages!

-   Install dependencies by `pip install -r requirements.txt`
