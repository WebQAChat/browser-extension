## A chrome browser extension that can answer your questions about a webpage

### Tasks:
Task 1. This is optional but it will be helpful for everyone to first understand how llama index works:
  - [ ] Familiarize yourself with the Llama Index API and its documentation https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html
    * [ ] We will be using GPTVectorStoreIndex https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/index_structs/vector_store_guide.html to create vector embeddings for each context
  - [ ] Take a look at DataLoader (classes to load data from different sources) called Web Page Reader https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/data_connectors/WebPageDemo.html where it scraped content from the url of a webpage

Task 2. You will need your own openai api key to run the extension:
  - [ ] Create an openai account, if you donâ€™t have one, and obtain an access API key

For the following two tasks, I could either assign people or let you guys choose. Since we have four people, two people for each task would be sufficient:

Task 3. Frontend:
  - [ ] Plan the layout and design of the chatbot interface within the browser extension.
    * [ ] Create HTML/CSS templates to structure and style the interface.
    
Task 4. Backend:
  - [ ] Implement the chatbot functionality:
    * [ ] Write JavaScript code to handle user input and generate responses.
    * [ ] Utilize the trained GPT model to generate dynamic responses based on user queries.
    * [ ] Integrate the Llama Index API calls to provide additional information or context.
