### How to run your api endpoint from your local server

-   First, make sure you have activated your virtual environment. If you see (venv) - the name of your virtual environment within parentheses just before your command prompt, you are good to go.

-   Second, make sure you are in /api directory.

-   Then, execute `python app.py` in command prompt to run your local server.

-   After you finished testing the api endpoint, you may terminate the program and deactivate your virtual environment by typing `deactivate` in command prompt.

-   Later, we could deploy our api endpoint on any cloud (hosting) service provider.
