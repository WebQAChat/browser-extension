### Model Endpoint

-   We will be using Flask to create an API endpoint for our web extension's gpt model.
-   See here to learn more about how to create an api endpoint using python and flask: https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/create-restful-api-using-python-and-flask/

After we have finished creating an endpoint, we can run it from our local computer.

### Running your api endpoint

-   First, make sure you have activated your virtual environment. If you see (venv) - the name of your virtual environment within parentheses just before your command prompt, you are good to go.

-   Second, make sure you are in /api directory.

-   Then, execute `python app.py` in command prompt to run your local server.

-   After you finished testing the api endpoint, you may terminate the program and deactivate your virtual environment by typing `deactivate` in command prompt.

-   Later, we could deploy our api endpoint on any cloud (hosting) service provider.
